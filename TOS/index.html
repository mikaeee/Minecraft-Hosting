                            We have done our best to make the Terms of Use as short and understandable as possible. <br />
                            The following terms and conditions apply to all registered users of our website www.phoenixthrush.com and any related services such as game servers (hereinafter referred to as “Server”).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By registering on the Website or using any of our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. <br />

                        <h3>§1 - Age Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            By registering on our website, you agree that you are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country of residence. If you are old enough to use our services but do not meet the
                            minimum age of digital consent, a parent or legal guardian must read and agree to the Terms of Use on your behalf. Please ask your parent or guardian to do so. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you allow
                            your child to use the Services, then these Terms apply to you, and you are responsible for your childs activities while using our Services.

                            Although we cannot guarantee full uptime of your servers, the Site and any services it hosts are generally available 24 hours a day and may go offline for many reasons, including but not limited to planned and
                            emergency maintenance, unexpected interruptions, hardware failures, data center downtime, and other unlisted reasons. It is impossible to guarantee that a service will be completely error-free, and we therefore
                            accept no responsibility for any loss of revenue, data or other damage caused by downtime.
                        </p>

                            we will assume they have accepted our changes. Existing users will continue to follow the old policy until the 7-day period expires or they agree to the new policy. Any new users who register, even before the
                            7-day period has expired, will be deemed to have agreed to the new policies.
                        </p>
